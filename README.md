Project for MEM-264 Applied Statistics course, of the Applied Mathematics Department of University of Crete.

In this project, we will try to predict the box office revenue (in dollars) of movies. It has 2 main components,
an exploratory data analysis where we look into the data variables and look for correlations w.r.t. the target variable.
On the second part, we use multiple regression to predict movie revenue.

You can find the task description [here](Programming_assignment.pdf). Finally, a report on our work may also be found [here]().
